# fun-with-mathematica

Collection of Mathematica notebooks that were created for fun.

    (1) magicsqt.nb
  
   This notebook is a direct search for potential 3x3 magic squares of squares. Limited by memory, we find a lower bound of e > 21125 for the square's existence, where e is the square root of the central element.
   
    (2) Wifi_numerics.nb
  
   This notebook computes numerically the stationary WiFi pattern in a given configuration of walls and wifi antennae. In the example considered in the notebook we place two antennae in the corners of a closed square room.
